# My Vibe Coding Prompts

## Prompt 1: Initial Build
**What I asked:** "Build me a craps dice game one or two players with the option of the computer playing against player one during a solo match with sound"

**What the AI did:** It generated a complete HTML file with CSS and JavaScript

**What worked:** The file opened in my browser and showed a grid, the overall game worked.

**What didn't work:** Clicking the sound button didn't do anything no sound played.
also when it was the computer vs a single player the computer function wsas not working.

Prompted AI to remove the sound option and reformat the code so that when the game is in single player mode the computer it will automatically roll the dice.

**What I learned:** AI can create the structure quickly but may miss functionality

## Prompt 2: fixed the look of the game 
 
Prompt AI to enhance the look of the game by adding color and effects 

AL generated a complete HTML file.

The overall look of the game was changed and lots of lightning affects.

what didn't work was the color match up, the background and the lights were refelcting and clashing with wach other.

## Prompt 3: removed the sound option and added a game mode 

Prompt AL to remove the sound option and add a game mode option that allows the user to choose if its one or two players.

AI generated a complete HTML file.

The sound option was removed and the user now can choose between the number of players, with the computer playing during solo options.
